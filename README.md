# Group4 (dar), Big Data - Fall 2020
- Welcome to our source code for this final project. Please read the individual READMEs for each of the 3 subdirectories to understand how to use the parsers and view sample outputs from our large data runs: 
1. [Phone numbers](phone-numbers/README.md)
2. States and Boroughs
3. Zipcodes, Latitudes & Longitudes

- Please contact us for examples with the full 1-25 million row datasets. Github won't let us put them here... We've included random samples within the individual parser directories.
